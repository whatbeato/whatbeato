### Welcome in!
Hey there, I'm fonz, a Hack Clubber, Event Organizer and (sometimes) coder.
I'm currently working in the Club Operations team @ Hack Club HQ and I build and design a lot of cool stuff for them.

If you're curious about my work - my GitHub is the worse place to find it. Find my LinkedIn or Hack Club Slack and we can chat about projects I've done.
